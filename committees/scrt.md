Greetings to one and all, and welcome to the United Nations Social Convention on Religion and Terror,

Before getting into the formalities, I’d like to introduce myself a little better. I’m in the 12th grade, I study humanities I have a keen interest in MUN, especially DSMUN. apart other MUN’s, DSMUN has always been very close to me and to be chairing a committee is truly a privilege. Dramatics has always been an integral part of my life in school ever since my first founder’s production, I indeed cherish every moment that I’m on stage. As far as sports go, I play both football and hockey further I follow football religiously, I am a huge Manchester United fan. I am an avid reader and an aspiring lawyer, I’m open for conversations on any topic ranging from politics to sports outside the committee.

When I first got to know that I had been appointed chairperson of this committee, I sat with my deputy chairpersons and we discussed what to make of this committee, and frankly, it was an outpour of ideas which were, after much debate and discussion, put to paper. After coming to a final decision, our confluence of these ideas materialized into the committee that stands before us today. The Vatican has been a topic of massive controversy in the recent past and this holy place effectuated crime galore, and this is what the committee will revolve around.

Our committee dwells on the “Crimes of the Vatican” and will be a treat for all delegates, who are prepared, of course; because this roller-coaster of a committee will have unexpected twists and turns lurking in the corners.

All in all, I’m hoping that the committee will be a delightful and enjoyable learning experience for one and all. Hoping to see all of you at Chandbagh very soon! Best of luck!

Grace and peace to you from God, our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
