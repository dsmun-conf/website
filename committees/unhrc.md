Greetings Delegates!

My name is Samarth Mehra and as the chairperson of the United Nations’ Human Rights Council (UNHRC), I welcome you to the Doon School Model United Nations Conference, 2019 (DSMUN). I study in Grade 12, currently pursuing the ISC curriculum, with a deep interest in Economics and Finance. One of my key passions is Music and I love to play the Piano. In the co-curricular front, I take great pleasure in writing, debating, reading, and, evidently, participating in Model UNs. My first MUN experience was as a chit-boy in 2016, and since then I have participated in many such conferences, both in and out of school, serving both as a delegate and an executive board member.

In a world where our innumerable differences, inter alia, of caste, colour, creed, and ability lead to increasing social friction, the strengthening of a binding force as universal and ubiquitous as human rights becomes the only source of solidarity in the dire moments of discrepancy. As the inter-governmental body within the United Nations’ fabric responsible for addressing situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them, it is the duty of the UNHRC to focus its attention on the reviewing of religious laws and obligations that deprive people of their fundamental rights, and upholding the all-inclusive nature of human rights.

The delegates will be judged on their ambassadorial behaviour, adherence to foreign policy, ability to lobby, and come up with creative, economically and socially feasible, and easily sustainable solutions to the issues at hand. I cannot impress more on the delegates the importance of extensive research in order for the committee to be stimulating. The background guide provides some useful sources to help you in that process though it is not exhaustive. Delegates must also take cognizance of the cultural, economic, social, demographic, and geographic variations between participating nations, and that a one-size-fits-all approach will be of little use, if any at all.

The two Deputy Chairpersons, Viraj Gulati and Bhavtegh Singh Gill, will also help me in the running of the committee. Please feel free to contact us in case of any queries at <chair.hrc@doonschool.com>.

Finally, I look forward to welcoming you at DSMUN 2019 in August. Till then, I wish you all the best with your research.

Samarth Mehra
