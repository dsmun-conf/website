Dear Delegates,

As chairperson of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all to the 13th session of the Doon School Model United Nations.

The UNODC was set up in 1997, by combining the UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division in order to prevent the growth of illegal drug trade and use, and crime around the world. Narcoterrorism, i.e. “terrorism financed by profits from illegal drug trafficking” is on the hike, a problem that proliferates in all forms of drug abuse, political corruption and crime. The committee this year, shall endeavour to discuss and deliberate upon the impact that narcoterrorists have on geo-politics.

Democratic institutions and ideologies are constantly thwarted and eroded due to the malignant political influence of drug cartels and gangs, governments are toppled, and nations are subjected to utter chaos due to the anti-narcotic policies of their governments. Latin American Cartels and drug trade routes in the Golden Triangle have given rise to problems that will require this committee’s immediate action, thus the agenda “*the impact of narcoterrorism on geo-politics.*”

To make the committee more engaging this year, we shall have just one agenda, with a more varied group of countries, and a discussion that throws up tricky situations for all portfolios.
For more information, kindly refer to the Background Guide.
Since our agenda is quite broad, we would encourage the committee to debate and discuss strictly within the parameters set by the Executive Board in the background guide, and by the end, formulate a resolution that addresses the issues at hand. Needless to say, a thorough portfolio research as well as an in-depth knowledge of all parameters of discussion will be essential.

As for me, I currently pursue the ISC curriculum with a gruelling combination of Sciences and Economics. Outside the classroom, I am a serious pianist on many levels. I specialise in western art music, along with jazz/blues and band music. I am also involved in the school’s ensemble productions in various capacities. In fact, you might see me performing with the Doon School Popular Band during the conference. I play hockey and football, and also take a keen interest in reading (especially about world politics) and writing, being an editor of a few publications in school. I have also been involved with DSMUN for the past four years in different capacities. My deputy chairpersons (also suffering from mostly the same subject combination)—Rushil Choudhary and Rishav Misra—will also help me run committee. Kindly feel free to contact any one of us for any help, we shall be available at <chair.odc@doonschool.com>.

We hope to see you soon at Chandbagh and best of luck!
